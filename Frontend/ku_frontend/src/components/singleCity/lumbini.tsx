                        Lumbini, recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Site is a testament to the birth of Buddhism and a destination that radiates spirituality and peace. The centerpiece of Lumbini, the Maya Devi Temple, is believed to mark the exact spot where Buddha was born. It's a place of reverence and reflection, surrounded by a tranquil garden. You can explore the Ashoka Pillar, symbolizing Emperor Ashoka's role in spreading Buddhism, and visit the Lumbini Museum to delve into Buddha's life. Stroll through the Lumbini Park, surrounded by monasteries from Buddhist nations, and ascend the World Peace Pagoda for panoramic views.
                        Witness devotees from across the globe paying homage and meditating, and you&apos;ll find that Lumbini is not just a destination; it&apos;s a journey to the very origins of enlightenment.
